                    <b>Check Quality </b>
                    <p> &emsp; &emsp; Grapes Quality is decides according to its Grade. Grading means the 
                        sorting of the homogenous lots of the produce according to the fixed 
                        grade standards. Produce is graded in accordance with the various quality 
                        factors. The harvested bunches of grapes are graded as per their size of 
                        the berries and their colour. Before packing, the broken, decayed, deformed, 
                        undersized and discoloured berries are removed from the bunches, using a 
                        long nosed scissor.</p><br>
                    <div class="b1">Benefits: </div>
                    <li>Grading is beneficial to the farmers, traders as well as to the consumers. 
                    <li>Grading of the grapes before sale enables farmers to get better price for their produce. 
                    <li>Grading helps the consumers to get standard quality produce at fair price. 
                    <li>After grading, it is easier for the consumer to compare the prices of different qualities of a produce in the market. 
                    <li>Grading also reduces the cost of marketing. 
                    <li>Grading helps in segregation of grapes for raisin making, juice making, wine making etc.<br>

                        transportation and other marketing operations. It provides convenience in handling during transportation 
                        and storage. The grapes meant for the local market are packed in ventilated corrugated boxes 
                        (2kg and 10kg capacity), bamboo baskets (4kg-15kg) and plastic crates (6-12 kg). These boxes are lined 
                        with newsprint paper. Fine paper shred or fine hay is spread at the bottom and top of the box for cushioning. 
                        The open flaps of the box are secured firmly by an adhesive tape. The cartons are printed with information 
                        such as name of the variety, date of packing, weight, name of the consignee and consignor, destination for 
                        domestic markets.</p>

                        <b>Storage :</b>
                        <p> &emsp; &emsp; Fresh grapes can be stored in cold stores for a period of about 6 weeks. Grapes should be pre-cooled promptly 
                        after harvest in separate rooms with large refrigeration capacity, high air velocity and high relative humidity. 
                        They are normally pre-cooled at  1-2¬∞ C within 6 hours of harvest. After pre-cooling, the dual releasing Sulphur 
                        dioxide pads (Grape guard) are placed with their coated surfaces downwards 30 on the filled plastic pouches and 
                        covered with the polythene liner.</p><br>
                        <div class="b1">Cold Storage :</div>
                        <p> &emsp; &emsp; The cold storage of grape is done at the temperature varying between 0-2¬∞ C and relative humidity ranging 
                            from 90% to 95%. Cold storage of grapes extends the shelf life of grapes by 3 to 4 months. Besides, it also preserves the 
                            freshness of fruit, prevents decay and discoloration. In addition, it also minimizes the discolouration on account of 
                            moisture loss and maintains the stem in good 31 condition. Use of slow release grape guards further enhance the storage 
                            period in a cold storage. Since the cold storage do not have pre-cooling air movement facilities for quick cooling, 
                            pre-cooling prior to cold storage is a basic requirement for rapid removal of field heat. During storage, shattering of 
                            berry can be minimized by avoiding rough handling. Freezing is more in less sugar containing clusters and water loss is 
                            more in fruits of heavy bearing vineyards. The uniform maintenance of temperature and humidity prevents berry cracking.</p><br>

                            fresh fruit as a ‚Äúfarm fresh gift basket.‚Äù The dried grapes are known as raisins.</p><br>

                        <b>Transportation options for Grapes :</b>
                        <p> &emsp; &emsp; As grapes are harvested, they are packed into plastic containers lined with plastic sheeting. The 
                            containers are loaded onto a truck and pulled into the packing shed for processing. The grapes are sorted and 
                            placed directly into clamshells and weighed or the grapes will be transported in reefer containers with a remote 
                            container management solution that monitors atmospheric conditions inside the container and provides visibility 
                            of the same to the customers.</p><br>
